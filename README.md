Welcome to Wrapped Anytime, a project that uses Spotify's public API to neatly format users' data.
This project uses HTML, CSS, JS and React to make calls to Spotify's API, retrieve the data and format it into several different categories.
Top songs and artists over 3 different time periods (1 month, 6 months, lifetime) are displayed in an easy-to-see format.
This is my first project with HTML and CSS to make a website.
Can't get this uploaded as a website though, it won't work :(
